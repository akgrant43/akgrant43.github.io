title: Pharo VM GC Crash Summary
---

This blog post will be updated with the current status of my investigations and attempts to resolve this issue.

As people may be returning to this page multiple times it is largely in the reverse of the typical order, i.e. the latest information is at the top, introductory information is near the bottom, in particular the Symptoms section.


## Fixed!

Thanks to Cl√©ment's work the issue was identified as a bug in the compactor, for a full description see [GC Crash Explanation]({% post_url 2019-11-29-Clements-Description.md %}).

I've left the notes as is below, mostly as a reminder for me of what I was thinking (which was way off target).


## Old Notes


### Lines of Investigation

There appear to be a few things happening leading up to the crash:

- The `receiver` and `rcvr/clsr` pointers in the Frame aren't being updated when an object is moved during scavenging and compaction.
- `framePointer` is pointing to a Frame that is located in a free stack page.



### Rejected hypotheses

- FreeType in Pharo has caused multiple problems, but the crashes can be reproduced with minimal Pharo images that don't include FreeType.
- FFI can also be problematic, but nothing is using FFI during the tests, and the base image shows no inconsistencies.



### Random notes

- The crash has been reproduced with both the Cog and Stack VMs.



### Reproducing the issue

To reproduce the crash:

- Download a minimal image, e.g. http://files.pharo.org/image/80/Pharo8.0-SNAPSHOT-metacello.build.982.sha.3a0b722.arch.64bit.zip
- Download the current Pharo VM: `curl get.pharo.org/64/vm80 | bash`
- Create the following script in `gccrash.st`:

```
| aJson srcString anArray |
aJson := ZnEasy get: 'https://data.nasa.gov/resource/y77d-th95.json' asZnUrl.
srcString := aJson contents.
"srcString := 'y77d-th95.json' asFileReference contents."
Array streamContents: [ :aStream |
    1 to: 400 do: [ :i |
		Stdio stdout
			<< 'Start';
			lf; flush.
        aStream nextPutAll: (STON fromString: srcString).
		Smalltalk saveImageInFileNamed: 'Save.', (i printPaddedWith: $0 to: 3), '.image'.
		Stdio stdout
			<< 'Loop: ';
			print: i;
			lf; flush ] ].
```

Then run 


### Symptoms

Crash dumps normally show that a garbage collection of some sort is being performed at the time of the crash, e.g.

```

Two attributes tend to increase the chance of this type of crash happening:

1. A large Pharo image
2. The image has been saved many times.
