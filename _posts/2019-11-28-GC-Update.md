Adding some information based on memory from before creating this blog:

As part of my earlier (undocumented) investigations I added some assertions to check that when a Stack Page is being freed the current `framePointer` isn't on it.

It turns out that it happens quite a lot.  Most of the time there isn't any corruption, so my suspicion is that `framePointer` isn't being used during this time.  But it also happens right around the time the crash happens, so...

Setting `framePointer` to NULL every time the page is freed under it shows... no change to the crash.  It looks like the `framePointer` isn't valid at all times, but this doesn't actually cause a problem.

What would be nice is to modify `StackInterpreter>>printCallStack` so that it warns you when `framePoiner` is pointing to a free stack page.
